WHY THIS STRUCTURE WORKS
------------------------

• Each service has distinct value
• Natural progression: Build → Enhance → Host → Grow

NO LOST OPPORTUNITIES:
• Footer section catches creative projects
• Shows you're selective, not desperate
• Allows flexibility without diluting main message

PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING:
• Focused expertise commands higher prices
• Easier to market and explain
• Builds specialist reputation

ABOUT UI/UX WITHIN DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------

WHY KEEP UI/UX:
• What AI CAN'T Do:
  - Understand specific client needs
  - Create custom brand personality
  - Solve unique business problems
  - Make strategic design decisions
  - Conduct user research
  - Create emotional connections

• What AI CAN Do:
  - Generate generic layouts
  - Copy existing patterns
  - Basic color schemes
  - Placeholder content

POSITIONING UI/UX:
Instead of separate service, position as:
"Every project includes professional UI/UX design"

This adds value without complexity.
