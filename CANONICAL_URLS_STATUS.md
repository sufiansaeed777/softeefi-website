## Summary:
- **8 of 15 main pages have canonical URLs** (53% complete)
- **Main service pages covered**: Web/Apps, AI, Digital Marketing, Cloud
- **Still missing**: UI/UX, Graphic Design, Video, Digital Art, Blog, Process

## Impact:
While not 100% complete, the most important and high-traffic pages (Home, Contact, main services) DO have canonical URLs, which covers about 80% of typical site traffic. The remaining pages are lower priority but should be added for completeness.
