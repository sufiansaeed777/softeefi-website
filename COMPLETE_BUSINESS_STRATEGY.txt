FINAL THOUGHTS
--------------

The path from generalist to specialist is challenging but rewarding. By focusing on AI-powered web solutions with cloud infrastructure, you position yourself at the intersection of high demand and high value. This isn't about doing less—it's about doing fewer things exceptionally well.

Remember: The riches are in the niches. Every service you remove makes the remaining ones more valuable.

Success metrics to track:
• Average project value (should increase)
• Client quality (fewer price shoppers)
• Team expertise (deeper skills)
• Brand recognition (known for something)
• Profit margins (higher rates)

The goal isn't to serve everyone—it's to be the obvious choice for businesses seeking intelligent web solutions.
